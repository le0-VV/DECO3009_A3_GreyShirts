# Group Grey Shirt's repository

This is the repositoty for Group Grey Shirt's DECO3009 A3 VR experience assignment. As per Unity's official gitignore (see .gitignore) a lot of files have been excluded from being uploaded to here, such as Library and UserSettings


This project will open into an empty scene, this is expected behaviour. Our scene is named "DemoScene", not the one the project defaults to.


This project has only been built and tested on Oculus Quest 2 and 3, to configure the project build settings, follow [this guide by Meta](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/unity-build/) or the image below
